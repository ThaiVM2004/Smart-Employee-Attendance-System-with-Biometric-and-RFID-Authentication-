# Smart-Employee-Attendance-System-with-Biometric-and-RFID-Authentication-

## üîß Description
A smart employee attendance system that combines RFID, fingerprint, and facial recognition technologies. Built on a custom-designed 2-layer PCB, the system integrates multiple embedded platforms (ESP32, STM32, ESP32-CAM) to perform real-time data acquisition, cloud logging, and hardware-based user interaction.
## üß© Features
### Multi-factor Authentication:
- RFID tag scanning
- Fingerprint recognition
- Facial image capture via ESP32-CAM
### Google Sheets Integration:
Attendance logs are sent via HTTP to a Google Sheet using the ESP32.
### On-device Storage:
Captured images are saved locally on an SD card in ESP32-CAM.
### Admin Console via Serial Monitor:
- Register new employees
- List registered employees
- Delete employees
